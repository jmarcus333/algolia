Question 1:
Hello,

I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:

- Records
- Indexing

I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."

Cheers,
George

JEREMY MARCUS RESPONSE:

Hi George,

Great questions, and very common ones as well. Let's start with search indexes. A search index is a special repository for your data that is optimized for quick retrieval. Whether it's products, hotel properties, or any other set of data, no matter how large, the index will make sure you can get to the data very quickly. That's the crux of the search index: searching and sorting large sets of data for rapid retrieval.

Now let's talk about records. Each individual piece of data, again a good example would be an individual product, is known as a record in the search index. In the case of a product, an individual record has attributes, like product name, product description, etc. and those attributes are used in search queries. Attributes can be marked as searchable, promoted/demoted, used in sorting rules, etc. by the administrator. This is a separate discussion and I'm happy to jump on a call to explain these concepts further if necessary.

Finally, indexing is the process of inserting your data into the index, either one record at a time or in bulk. In the indexing process the data is organized into records and attributes that can be queried, displayed, or tuned for optimum searchability.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions, and again I'm happy to jump on a call to explain any of this further.

Regards,
Jeremy

Question 2:
Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Regards,
Matt

JEREMY MARCUS RESPONSE:

Hi Matt,

We welcome and appreciate the honest feedback. Our product is continually evolving to create the best experience possible for our users, but we understand that sometimes there will be instances where an improvement may have unintended consequences on other areas. In these cases there will be further review to address these experiences and the effects they can have on our users.

Having said that, there are a number of ways you can improve your experience, for example using the API to automate processes that take too many clicks.

Again, we appreciate your honesty and apologize for any productivity issues it caused. If you'd like, we can jump on a call and talk through some idas on how to improve your experience.

Feel free to reach out any time.

Regards,
Jeremy

Question 3:
Hi,

I'm looking to integrate Algolia in my website. Will this be a lot of development work for me? What's the high level process look like?

Regards,
Leo

JEREMY MARCUS RESPONSE:

Hi Leo,

Thank you for your interest in Algolia. We have streamlined the process for onboarding new customers and can often have a working proof of concept in as little as a few hours.

The biggest variable is the current structure of your data so we'll work together to format it such that it can be indexed by the engine. We have seen many formats of data so we're confident that we will be able to have yours processed in short order. If you can tell us the current format, and ideally provide a sample, we can get a head start on the process.

In any case, there will be no development work necessary in the process of setting up the search index.

In terms of a high level process, as I've alluded to the main task is formatting your data. After formatting and indexing the data, the rest of the process is simply using the Admin console to optimize the retrieval of the data.

There is obviously a UI element to this as well, which we'll need to discuss further, but we do have sample UI experiences that leverage our APIs to provide a fully fleshed out window into your data.

Let's have a quick call and figure out the quickest path to getting your data indexed and begin the process of integrating Algolia into your web site.

Regards,
Jeremy
