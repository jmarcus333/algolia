The goal of my project, beyond it being a mandatory assignment as part of the Algolia SE position interview process, was to understand the Algolia platform and compare it to other search providers with which I’m familiar. Specifically, to go through the exercise of importing data, tuning it to my specifications, and seeing it presented in a UI, in as little time as possible. All of this was accomplished in a matter of hours after some fits and starts. I chose the e-commerce (Best Buy) data set and had planned on building a product details page of sorts, but had some issues with the code, specifically I was not able to find good “bottom up” code to begin my project. I ended up installing the Instant Search UI from GitHub and it worked like a charm.

So with the data loaded and the UI installed, I went about tuning the data for better search relevance. All the tools were there and it was very easy to iteratively make adjustments to the index and see the results real time. I’ve gone ahead and made my settings public so the relevance tuning can be evaluated.

Overall this was a great assignment, challenging but rewarding. I do wish I’d had a little more time - I’m still working full time at Salesforce and it’s the end of our Q3 - to get familiar with the code before the deadline, but since I still have my trial account and all available assets I’ll have time to dig in more deeply and understand the UI piece at my leisure.
